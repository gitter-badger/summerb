`Summerb` is a library, which was created to significantly reduce boilerplate code in new Java and Spring-based web application projects.

Summerb provides building blocks designed with 2 things in mind: 

1. Enable bootstrap of regular CRUD-based application development very fast

2. Allow to grow application in long-term perspective as requirements evolve (in contrast to frameworks like Groovy-on-Grails, which gives you lighting-fast head start, but then become a bottleneck in a long run)

Software Development is an art and vast area for (re)interpretation, because same functionality can be implemented gizzilion different ways. This library is an opinionated application of [DRY, SLAP and SOLID](https://www.slideshare.net/skarpushin/solid-ood-dry) design principles. 

But since this is a library (not a framework), it was quite easy to make it plug-and-play, almost any part of this library can be replaced and augmented by your custom implementation. 

Since 2015, this library was used in a number of commercial and personal projects, proven to serve its purpose. Since then it was improved number of times. 

This library covers following topics: i18n, Validation, Authorization, CRUD and couple services like Users, Properties and Articles (for micro-CMS). 

Please refer to [Wiki](https://github.com/skarpushin/summerb/wiki) for the reference to documentation. Also, since CRUD is the biggest part of this library, there is a separate [article](https://github.com/skarpushin/summerb/wiki/EasyCrud-Overview) written to describe its usage in detail.
